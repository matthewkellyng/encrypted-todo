# React + TypeScript + Vite

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

This is a default template customised to include some basic tools that I find helpful. Feel free to use it as you see fit.

## TODO

- [ ] Add fleshed out readme page describing the tooling
- [ ] Add cspell (eslint) plugin
- [ ] Add stand alone cspell for spell checking git messages
- [x] Add husky and commit lint
- [x] Add vitest for testing
- [x] Add tailwind
- [x] Add commitizen with commit lint adapter to maintain one shared config
- [ ] Potential add msw?
- [ ] Add dependabot or renovate or some dependency updating manager
- [ ] Add release-it or some sort of conventional commits release tool
